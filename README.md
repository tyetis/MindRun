# MindRun
 Artificial intelligence application that solves logic problems

MindRun Project is an artificial intelligence application for developed to solve math equations with Python and Sympy Library. MindRun can solve algebraic and verbal problems

# Example
baba = person("baba")

cocuk1 = person("cocuk1")

cocuk2 = person("cocuk2")

baba.age = 27

AddEq(cocuk1.age + cocuk2.age, 9)

SetTime(x)

baba.age = (cocuk1.age + cocuk2.age) * 2
